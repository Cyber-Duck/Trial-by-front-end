# Developer's brief
## General information
This front-end test has been designed to bring out your skills as a front end developer. We will take into consideration the quality of your code, your speed to complete the tasks, your ability to understand the requirements and how close you can match the designs provided.

The test should be completed entirely. Remember to roughly record the time used to complete the test, we will require this information along with the test files.

### Rules of the test
- All coding must be done manually
- Do not use a CSS reset
- Do not use Bootstrap or any other full framework
- Sass is required
- It must be responsive
- Do not use IDs for selectors in the CSS
- You can use CSS plugins for effects / animations

### Setup & Installation
The files provided are a starter pack that contains everything you need to complete the test. You must have a recent version of NodeJS installed + Gulp 4 to get the build system to run. 

Simply clone the repository, navigate to root folder and run `npm install` to get all the dependencies, then run `gulp` to watch the files as you work.

The HTML file provided has been already linked to the compiled CSS, JS and it contains the links to fonts used (Merryweather & Open Sans).

All the icons and images are provided, you must define how to use them and how to apply effects to them to match the design.

### Details
Please pay close attention to the design at all breakpoints to ensure you understand how to code it (repeating content and show/hide on breakpoints is not accepted).

We expect to see the correct types of HTML elements, tags and attributes used depending on what the function of the component is, such as links, buttons, blockquotes, input types, link targets, image tags (or CSS backgrounds), etc.

If you find a design error, please feel free to send us a comment and we will review.

### First stage
In the first stage, the following is expected to be completed:

- Responsive layout
- Main menu links must show `:hover` styles
- Markup should be standard and semantic code
- We value accessibility & performance

### Second stage
The second stage will be starting from first stage's code and it should try to complete the following tasks, but is't all optional.

- Animations
- Javascript/Effects (animated menu, sticky header, back to top, toggle menu/search, reveal on scroll, etc, up to you)
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Enhanced performance features and optimisations
- Schema markup / microdata

Please note this test is not a for a fail/pass scenario. We will use the test results to understand you as a developer and see where you are in some specific topics. The design has been specifically made to check a variety of skills. The score will be completely at our discretion and we may not share this with the applicants. If you're interested in our feedback, we are happy to provide it on request.

If you're an agency or recruiter and want to use this test to evaluate your applicants, please get in touch with Cyber-Duck Ltd.

Happy coding,

Ramon Lapenta
